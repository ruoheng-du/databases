# Databases | Spring 2024
This is the repository for databases system project doned in Databases course at NYU Shanghai during Spring 2024. The project focuses on the design and implementation of a relational database system along with an associated web-based application. It involves building an online air ticket reservation system, and the system allows three types of users—Customers, Booking Agents, and Airline Staff—to interact with the database in various ways. The goal is to ensure effective database operations like querying, inserting, and deleting while providing an interactive web-based interface with visualizations and security. The project uses Python Flask for the backend, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, and MySQL for the database. Please feel free to email me at ruoheng.du@nyu.edu for any more information.
